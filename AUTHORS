wad2svg, and the Doom:: modules included for accessing WAD files, is written by
Colin Phipps <cph@cph.demon.co.uk>. See the README file for more information on
the program, places to go for help or to contribute to the program.

It grew out of a program called wadgd, which I wrote back in 2000 as the start
on a project to draw maps of Doom levels overlayed with information extracted
from demo files (showing speed demo routes etc). This project never finished,
but it did get far enough to draw Doom maps to gif/png files. When I needed a
tool for drawing a map of the Nodes (for debugging BSP) I originally began to
adapt wadgd for this; however I decided that using a bitmap graphics library for
drawing what is esssentially a vector image was rather foolish, so I started
from scratch and wrote wad2svg.
